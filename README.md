# Java-PokerGame

I developed a game that delivers a 5-card hand to each player, where the user can select between 3 and 10 players, with no duplicate cards. Each card has its own individual number that is displayed next to the card. For example, Ace of Spades (Card 1). This is how I can show that there truly are no duplicate cards being distributed to the players.
